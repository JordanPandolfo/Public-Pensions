- Comparative static exercises for varying state-specific parameters

- Tested against a baseline case which is the pvl-weighted average of 
    our sample

    - ARC % = .92
    - FR = .72
    - b = 34
    - prop pub = .1
    - risky share = .74
    - state discount = .072
    - pvl ($ 000) = 108,000,000 (so billions)
